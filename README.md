Hr Data Analysis
In this project I have created insights for HR data using Power BI.

Data cleaning:
Load the data set into power bi and transform data in power query editor according to requirements.
Created required columns and measures using DAX function to visualize data in a better shape.

Data visualization:
Used about measures to display the sick leave count, Present percentage in office, total working dates, working from home percentage of the employees.
