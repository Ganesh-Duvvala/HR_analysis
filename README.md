Hr Data Analysis

In this project, I have created insights for HR data using Power BI.

Data cleaning:

Load the data set into Power BI and transform data in Power Query editor according to requirements.
Created required columns and measures using the DAX function to visualize data in a better shape.

Data visualization:

Used measures to display the sick leave count, Present percentage in the office, total working dates, and working from home percentage of the employees.
